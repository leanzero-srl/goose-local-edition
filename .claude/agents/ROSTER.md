# The roster's own ledger — how these agents improve, and how new ones get minted

Ordered by Mihai 2026-08-30: *"have a mechanism please for constantly improving these little parts
plus adding new ones in other areas of the project."* This file is that mechanism's memory. The
charters are living documents with the same law as the skills: a stale charter is worse than none,
because it reads authoritative.

## The improvement loop — runs on EVERY delegation, in the same turn as the synthesis

When a roster agent returns, the orchestrator grades the return in one line before using it, on
four questions, and AMENDS THE CHARTER IN THE SAME TURN when any answer is yes:

1. **Charter gap** — did the agent need a rule/fact its charter lacked (it asked, guessed, or the
   brief had to carry standing rules)? → move the rule INTO the charter, with the receipt.
2. **Charter unclear** — did it violate a rule its charter carried? → sharpen the rule with the
   quoted miss (the rebuke-table pattern: his words / the incident ≤80 chars, then the rule).
3. **Charter bloat** — did it receive charter material irrelevant to its whole surface (not just
   this task)? → trim. Charters stay under ~900 words of load-bearing text.
4. **Brief leak** — did the ORCHESTRATOR's brief carry context the agent didn't use? → note the
   over-briefing here so the next brief is leaner.

A miss that cost a commit, a kill, or a rebuke gets its receipt QUOTED in the charter — rules
without their reasons get cleaned up by later readers.

## Minting new agents — the trigger is repetition, not ambition

- The SAME kind of work briefed inline twice with no matching charter → the THIRD time mints an
  agent (the skills prime directive applied to agents). Mint = charter + this ledger's row + a
  CLAUDE.md roster-table line, one commit.
- An agent whose grading shows two DISTINCT rule-sets fighting for space → split it.
- An agent not delegated to in a long stretch is NOT deleted for that — it is checked for
  staleness against its sources instead.

## Staleness audit — the gate-auditor turned on the roster itself

Each charter footer names its AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES. When a source changes materially (a gate
moves, an invariant is added, a mechanism is deleted), the touching commit re-checks the charters
naming it — the `words-reader`/`gate-auditor` can be pointed at a charter + its sources with the
question "does this charter describe the current system?" Periodically (each campaign phase
boundary), run one gate-auditor pass over the whole roster.

## Candidate agents not yet minted (from the measured fracture lines) — mint on trigger, not now

| candidate | would own | minting trigger |
|---|---|---|
| run-forensics | post-run/post-kill archaeology: the full story from run.jsonl + activity, per phase, with citations | third inline forensics brief |
| launch-officer | the launch/kill/relaunch procedure (today the orchestrator's — deliberately, it carries the checkpoints) | only if the orchestrator's context pressure demands it |
| campaign-scribe | NOW.md/RUN-LEDGER/TICK-NOTES coherence after big days | third inline doc-sweep brief |
| feature-dev surgeon | non-swarm goose features (goose-feature-dev skill's surface) | first real feature task outside the swarm |
| publish-officer | leanzero.net board publishing (guarded exact-id publisher) | next publish task |
| cloud-campaign runner | the cloud-sb7 admission machinery | when that campaign resumes |

## Grading log (newest first — one line per delegation; move closed items to the per-agent notes)
- 2026-08-30 words-reader #1 (r5 opener, live): CLEAN PASS — contract followed exactly (quotes with
  offsets, shapes after words, improvements derived from quotes, falsifier named); refuted the
  orchestrator's implied stall and found two prompt defects + a missing bound instead. No charter
  gap, no brief leak. Its falsifier ("if the next ~5k chars re-open the S4 fork, that becomes real
  cycling and the judge's empty next an undelivered steer") adopted as the live watch.

- 2026-08-30 ui-truth batch (general-purpose, pre-roster): two spec deviations argued correctly by
  the agent (F8 event-carry vs digest-join, F22 not-independently-shippable) → panel-surgeon's
  charter already carries the digest-join contract; ADDED to its charter: nothing (the agent's
  argument was the charter working). Brief leak: none observed.
- 2026-08-30 gate-8 tracers (workflow, pre-roster): traces validated their own replay against
  logged values to 4 decimals — that discipline is now IN fix-tracer's charter ("a replay that
  matches logs to 3+ decimals is a measurement; one you cannot validate is an estimate").
