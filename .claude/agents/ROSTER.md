# The roster's own ledger — how these agents improve, and how new ones get minted

Ordered by Mihai 2026-08-30: *"have a mechanism please for constantly improving these little parts
plus adding new ones in other areas of the project."* This file is that mechanism's memory. The
charters are living documents with the same law as the skills: a stale charter is worse than none,
because it reads authoritative.

## The improvement loop — runs on EVERY delegation, in the same turn as the synthesis

When a roster agent returns, the orchestrator grades the return in one line before using it, on
four questions, and AMENDS THE CHARTER IN THE SAME TURN when any answer is yes:

1. **Charter gap** — did the agent need a rule/fact its charter lacked (it asked, guessed, or the
   brief had to carry standing rules)? → move the rule INTO the charter, with the receipt.
2. **Charter unclear** — did it violate a rule its charter carried? → sharpen the rule with the
   quoted miss (the rebuke-table pattern: his words / the incident ≤80 chars, then the rule).
3. **Charter bloat** — did it receive charter material irrelevant to its whole surface (not just
   this task)? → trim. Charters stay under ~900 words of load-bearing text.
4. **Brief leak** — did the ORCHESTRATOR's brief carry context the agent didn't use? → note the
   over-briefing here so the next brief is leaner.

A miss that cost a commit, a kill, or a rebuke gets its receipt QUOTED in the charter — rules
without their reasons get cleaned up by later readers.

## Minting new agents — the trigger is repetition, not ambition

- The SAME kind of work briefed inline twice with no matching charter → the THIRD time mints an
  agent (the skills prime directive applied to agents). Mint = charter + this ledger's row + a
  CLAUDE.md roster-table line, one commit.
- An agent whose grading shows two DISTINCT rule-sets fighting for space → split it.
- An agent not delegated to in a long stretch is NOT deleted for that — it is checked for
  staleness against its sources instead.

## Staleness audit — the gate-auditor turned on the roster itself

Each charter footer names its AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES. When a source changes materially (a gate
moves, an invariant is added, a mechanism is deleted), the touching commit re-checks the charters
naming it — the `words-reader`/`gate-auditor` can be pointed at a charter + its sources with the
question "does this charter describe the current system?" Periodically (each campaign phase
boundary), run one gate-auditor pass over the whole roster.

## Candidate agents not yet minted (from the measured fracture lines) — mint on trigger, not now

| candidate | would own | minting trigger |
|---|---|---|
| run-forensics | post-run/post-kill archaeology: the full story from run.jsonl + activity, per phase, with citations | third inline forensics brief |
| launch-officer | the launch/kill/relaunch procedure (today the orchestrator's — deliberately, it carries the checkpoints) | only if the orchestrator's context pressure demands it |
| campaign-scribe | NOW.md/RUN-LEDGER/TICK-NOTES coherence after big days | third inline doc-sweep brief |
| feature-dev surgeon | non-swarm goose features (goose-feature-dev skill's surface) | first real feature task outside the swarm |
| publish-officer | leanzero.net board publishing (guarded exact-id publisher) | next publish task |
| cloud-campaign runner | the cloud-sb7 admission machinery | when that campaign resumes |

## The works-prover fan (standing practice, Mihai 2026-08-30)

After ANY batch of landed implementation: fan read-only works-provers, ONE PER CLAIM, each brief
SHARP — the claim, the anchors, what proof counts. Never one dummy agent told "verify the batch";
that produces an agent that "just does something to finish." Verdicts WORKS / APPEARS-TO-WORK /
CANNOT-PROVE, quotes mandatory; APPEARS-TO-WORK findings are implemented-or-scheduled on arrival
like any finding. THE CHECKING LAW (Mihai 2026-08-30 14:00): a handoff is a CLAIM, not a
delivery — the orchestrator checks every delivered build against the brief's goals before it
counts as done; big deliveries (the research fan) get their own prover pass against their
amendments. "This is not work to be done superficially." The doctrine: fallbacks only on many-happy-path arms; reachability proven
as-configured; no hard coding. First run: 2026-08-30 over the day's five landed changes.

## Surgeon #7 queue (dispatch when swarm.rs frees after #6 — the research fan)
(works-prover, next fan): is plan_loaded.plan_confidence_breakdown dead post-P1-5? conf_trail.py
and lever_check.py consume it; the ask event's twin field was confirmed dead 0/0.


1. ASK-TRUTH honest fix (works-prover confirmed): open_decisions_total/not_asked computed from a
   breakdown the sole call site passes as None (swarm.rs:27124-27132 vs :36704-36710) — pass the
   real count (opened.open_decisions.len()), revive the "will be GUESSED" stderr warning, and
   KILL the ask_max_q=3 truncation on this path (the guess-the-rest arm is a silent fallback on
   a 0-happy-path overflow; asking 5 costs the same one prompt as asking 3). Tests must traverse
   the primary arm (today all three pass breakdown=None — zero coverage of the computation).
2. Drift-hazard consts (works-prover minors): the 400ms coalesce literal x3 (forming :16799,
   digest sites :18160/:18988) -> one shared const; the 2,000-char look-tail literal x3
   (:15650/:17648/:18782) -> one shared const.
3. forming_write_failed lost on dispatch abort (event written only after the scoped future
   completes) — decide: acceptable-on-a-dying-call (document) or move the emission into the guard.
4b. fanout_over_fleet drops a panicked lane handle silently (if let Ok(r) = h.await) — a research
   or review lane that panics VANISHES with no row and no event (gate-1 class, surgeon #6's find,
   shared with the review fan): emit a loud per-lane event (lane_panicked{key}) and fold an
   unanswered/failed row instead of nothing.
4. Forming test coverage: the open-frame and late-opening ArgsDelta arms are traversed by zero
   tests (dead under LM Studio's measured shapes but live for id+name+args-in-one-delta providers)
   — add one fixture each.

## Grading log (newest first — one line per delegation; move closed items to the per-agent notes)
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #6 (research fan v2, 81cd50d38): PROVISIONAL CLEAN, delivery pending
  the prover pass (the checking law) — all 8 amendments accounted for with anchors; hit the
  fallback ratchet with 2 new unwrap_or_defaults and removed them STRUCTURALLY rather than
  bumping the baseline (the gate refusing exactly as designed); honest trace YES at r5's real
  slices_opened (25 questions over 3 one-per-host lanes vs the unamended 6 stacked lanes pasting
  54k each); quarantine scope stated honestly (tool-menu, not sandbox). Five unbriefed
  observations incl. fanout_over_fleet silently dropping a panicked lane handle (gate-1 class,
  shared with the review fan) — QUEUED for surgeon #7. Handed back the orchestrator items
  (tick rows, phase map, NOW risk) — all done same turn.
- 2026-08-30 bench-scorer #1 (unflatter asked_when_unsure, 2cf79d6d9 + loop-state e557940):
  CLEAN PASS — chose the primary by MEASURING the three candidates on r5 (open.json rolls,
  calls.jsonl truncates at 200, open.log carries the array whole), verified 0.6-vs-1.0 through
  the new code on the real run, replayed the archived bed before/after per charter, and made ONE
  judged deviation ARGUED correctly (archived non-zero totals stay measurable — a dead call site
  can only emit 0, so non-zero is evidence; zero licenses nothing) — flagged in code, commit,
  and test rather than smuggled. Closed a note-and-ignore trap it found (dead open_decisions
  variable now surfaced). QUEUED: its finding that plan_loaded.plan_confidence_breakdown may
  also be dead post-rewire (conf_trail.py:35, lever_check.py:93,105 read it) — works-prover
  material for the next fan. No charter gap.
- 2026-08-30 panel-surgeon #3 (forming UI + follow-ups, 66a302bfb/871dc729e): CLEAN PASS — the
  join needed NO code change and the surgeon said so instead of touching it (the whole-object
  pass-through IS the law working); forming outranks both channels in laneLiveLine with the rank
  pinned by test; the replay test made hermetic without clocks (stalest-heartbeat-first ordering,
  snapshot-once); the torn-read catch KEPT and relabeled for old binaries' archives rather than
  deleted. Four unbriefed observations; QUEUED for a future panel brief: the !hasWork stacked
  empty pane, structured-call full view. Its "parent moved under me" narrative misread cf2d573d8
  (my ROSTER-only commit) — harmless, noted. Typecheck contradiction with the IDE LSP settled by
  running the gate myself: clean; the LSP view is stale.
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #5 (forming capture provider+engine, 0fd574002): CLEAN PASS — verified
  the refuter's amendment in the code ("verbatim would not have compiled" — the get_mut binding),
  chose flush option (a) only AFTER reading both digest sites whole and proving option (b) added
  no coverage during true silence, stated the residual staleness honestly (a held fragment during
  total silence — the case where nothing new is forming), made the dirty flag earn a real read
  (held_unflushed in the failure event), held the unwrap_or_default ratchet, and enumerated all
  five stale UI comments for the panel brief instead of touching held files. Two unbriefed finds:
  probe-inside-scope forming leakage (pre-existing, commented) and fix-shard forming sidecars
  landing in the shadow dir the desktop never reads (QUEUED for a future engine brief). No
  charter gap.
- 2026-08-30 panel-surgeon #2 (folded durable inspector, 030ea1cb9): CLEAN PASS — nothing clears
  on phase end (history via deriveNodeHistory beside deriveFleet, ended chips, full-transcript
  on-demand IPC with engine-codec key encoding + containment check), the honesty pins are TESTS
  (38,780 stream chars vs 128,270 durable bytes pinned; finish-under-open-inspector persistence
  pinned), memory strategy argued not defaulted (release-on-collapse over LRU: page cache already
  holds the file), and the drift-guard fixture deliberately unextended with the reason stated.
  Seven unbriefed observations. QUEUED for panel #3: jump-to-start affordance (Mihai's ask was
  the cut BEGINNING), symmetric Work-pane show-all, replay-test live-run race fix, laneless-call
  interrupted-state gap. tick_ui clickability rule revisit queued for next-build install. No
  charter gap.
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #4 (restream seed carries formed tail, 63ebe140b): CLEAN PASS — made
  the seed a PURE FUNCTION so a real test seam exists instead of theater; matched the file's
  established tail idiom (2,000-char tail_chars, the judge's own look scale) rather than inventing
  a truncation; proved the empty-tail case REACHABLE (pending-tool-request/RESTART restreams with
  no thinking) so the honest-absence branch is earned, not decorative; followed the change to
  every describer comment (the "does not go looking" narrative was now false and changed with the
  code); honestly bounded trace (YES at 09:24:12, but only the last 2,000 chars — older rows still
  lost, structural buffer bound stated). Three unbriefed observations: tick.py printer (fixed by
  orchestrator same turn), panel not surfacing the field (folded into next panel brief), closing
  line could be sharper (correctly left minimal). No charter gap.
- 2026-08-30 panel-surgeon #1 (stale-cell render path): CLEAN PASS — refused the instrument's
  diagnosis and proved the chain link by link over live CDP (digest fresh, fiber memoizedProps
  fresh, DOM frozen), found the real mechanism (useSmoothText rAF fires 0x while the window is
  hidden), fixed BOTH sides with tests (goose 2696b926d, loop-state b27818f), closed it with a
  natural experiment (window visible -> lane advanced), and correctly ruled the WASTE duplicates
  by-design (two surfaces, two sources). Four unbriefed observations reported-not-fixed. CHARTER
  STALENESS fixed this turn: the "2 skipped realfs push tests" expectation does not match plain
  `pnpm test` (they live under the integration config) — charter line amended.
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #3 (splice_briefs unclaimed-brief files, 7b5171998): CLEAN PASS —
  ordering proof given unprompted (splice runs before review/finalize, so the repair chain sees the
  appended files and repair_shared_files backstops residual overlap), read-whole list includes the
  fallback-path twin's doc comment, honest NO trace (structural net — every prior unclaimed append
  died at owns-nothing), both test halves pinned (declared-files survive; declaration-free ghost
  still removed). Two unbriefed observations reported-not-fixed per charter: RUN-LEDGER churn
  (known, auto-snapshot) and a stale splice_briefs comment narrating the deleted orphan-research
  block. SCHEDULED: fold the comment fix into the next swarm-surgeon brief. No charter gap.
- 2026-08-30 words-reader #1 (r5 opener, live): CLEAN PASS — contract followed exactly (quotes with
  offsets, shapes after words, improvements derived from quotes, falsifier named); refuted the
  orchestrator's implied stall and found two prompt defects + a missing bound instead. No charter
  gap, no brief leak. Its falsifier ("if the next ~5k chars re-open the S4 fork, that becomes real
  cycling and the judge's empty next an undelivered steer") adopted as the live watch.
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #1 (opener-text fixes, 14831a321): CLEAN PASS — honest TRACE VERDICT (NO
  for the live lane, fires next run), consumer follow-through verified unprompted (SYNTHESIS gets
  objectives whole), two unbriefed finds reported-not-fixed per charter (SliceBrief.files always
  empty + four sibling take(400) truncation sites). No charter gap; the
  report-don't-fix-unbriefed rule earned its keep on its first outing.
- 2026-08-30 swarm-surgeon #2 (files-from-objectives + truncation siblings, 5316de72f/176c4513f):
  CLEAN PASS — full reader list with per-reader verdicts, honest leave-alone reasons (events and
  test strings excluded from sentence-ending), honest NO-trace on finding 2 (ships as a net), one
  new unbriefed find (splice_briefs' hardcoded files:[] feeds the owns-nothing removal) reported
  not fixed. No charter gap. Pattern holding: each surgeon pass mines the next brief.

- 2026-08-30 ui-truth batch (general-purpose, pre-roster): two spec deviations argued correctly by
  the agent (F8 event-carry vs digest-join, F22 not-independently-shippable) → panel-surgeon's
  charter already carries the digest-join contract; ADDED to its charter: nothing (the agent's
  argument was the charter working). Brief leak: none observed.
- 2026-08-30 gate-8 tracers (workflow, pre-roster): traces validated their own replay against
  logged values to 4 decimals — that discipline is now IN fix-tracer's charter ("a replay that
  matches logs to 3+ decimals is a measurement; one you cannot validate is an estimate").
