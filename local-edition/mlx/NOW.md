# NOW — MLX in-house engine campaign (branch goose/mlx-inferencing)

**Read this FIRST after any compaction, before anything else in this dir.** Budget ~2k tokens.
Rule: when the thread changes, this file changes IN THE SAME COMMIT.

## The mission (Mihai, 2026-08-30)
Add an in-house, open-source MLX inference engine that goose itself supervises — **NEXT TO LM Studio,
never replacing it**. It supersedes only the built-in `goose-local-inference` FFI path. Primary
workload: **the swarm** — N concurrent long-context tool-calling agents. Plus: a starter desktop UI
window (engine control: mount/unmount, sampling incl. presence penalty, context length; HF browser:
MLX-only search + download into a configurable `models_dir`). Full plan:
`~/.claude/plans/i-want-you-to-enumerated-hejlsberg.md`.

## Hard constraints (Mihai's words, do not relax)
- Tests use **qwen3.5-9b 4-bit ONLY, freshly downloaded**. Mounting the fleet's 27B is FORBIDDEN for now.
- The running LM Studio fleet must not be disturbed: memory gate before ANY mount (`gates.py`),
  `lms ps` snapshot/verify around every session, sidecar never on ports 1234/11434.
- One configurable `models_dir` (default `~/.goose/models`) for downloads AND mounts — not tied to LM Studio.

## State at last write (2026-08-30)
- Branch created off local-edition @ 5d238baa5 (pulled 779 commits first; agentic structure now in-repo).
- Finalists: **Rapid-MLX** (raullenchai/Rapid-MLX — tool parsers, decode speed, goose precedent) vs
  **oMLX** (jundot/omlx — continuous batching, prefix-sharing paged KV + SSD tier, memory guard).
  MTPLX + mlx-serve dropped → see TRUMP-CARDS.md. Verdict comes from the swarm-shaped bake-off, NOT web claims.
- **Inherited hazard (docs/EXPERIMENTS.md spike, 2026-06-25): on Gated-DeltaNet hybrids (all our qwens),
  a prefix-cache HIT can silently break tool-calling (omlx #825, mlx-lm #980). LM Studio was chosen over
  raw mlx-lm/omlx for exactly this. The bake-off scores this as a first-class dimension.**

## Restart, in order
1. `cat local-edition/mlx/NOW.md && cat local-edition/mlx/LEDGER.md | head -60`
2. `git log --oneline -10` on branch goose/mlx-inferencing
3. `python3 local-edition/mlx/gates.py probe` (memory state) and `~/.lmstudio/bin/lms ps` (fleet state)
4. Continue from "The one decision waiting" below.

## Operating mode
**UNATTENDED (Mihai, 2026-08-30 ~23:00, going to sleep): full autonomy for the night.** Decide and
act on best knowledge; no questions; maintain house rules + agentic discipline; commit every step;
keep this file and the ledger current so restrictions and thread survive compaction. The approved
plan is the authorization for all of it — bake-off, fork, integration, UI.

## The one decision waiting
Bake-off not yet run. Next action: install both engines, download qwen3.5-9b-4bit through each,
run the swarm-shaped bench (1/4/8 streams + hybrid-prefix-cache tool-call test), record in
experiments.jsonl, write the verdict in LEDGER.md.
