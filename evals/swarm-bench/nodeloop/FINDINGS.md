# nodeloop — findings ledger

Chat is compacted away; this file is not. Every conclusion here is derived from an engine event
log, a source line, or a probe against the live fleet — never from a model's self-report.

## F1 — The 46-point "noise" is the detailer failing open (2026-08-01)

Three runs, identical config, identical 1-device pool, same spec:

| run | tasks whose spec stayed the architect's one-liner | build | tier C (vendor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swarm-1node-r0` | **2** of 14 — `meridian`, `test-api` | **44.2%** | 14.3% |
| `swarm-2node-r0` | **1** of 16 — `api` | **86.7%** | 100.0% |
| `swarm-3node-r0` | **0** of 14 | **90.0%** | 85.7% |

The architect emits a description of "ONE short line" (`swarm.rs:11494`). The detailer expands it
into an implementation-ready spec, one call per device, under a hard 75 s cap
(`swarm.rs:12353`); on timeout/empty/error the engine silently keeps the one-liner (the
`_ => brief` fallback) and **emits no event**.

Per-module trace, which is stronger than the correlation: in the 44.2% run `meridian` — the
vendor client tier C exists to grade — was dispatched with **95 characters**. In the 90% run the
same module received **2,464 characters** with the full class signature block, exact endpoints and
required headers. Tier C moved 14.3% → 85.7%.

## F2 — SUPERSEDED 2026-08-01 10:15 — node count IS a variable now

Mihai gave each host's loaded model a distinct identifier (`mihai-` / `workhorse-` / `gabee-`).
Everything below about the collapse was true of the fleet as it stood and is left intact, because
it explains why every earlier node-scaling number in this project is void. What is no longer true
is the conclusion that it could never be measured.

Re-proven after the change, by the same probe that condemned the old fleet: three concurrent calls,
one per identifier, put **all three instances into `generating` at once** (7.7 / 10.0 / 13.4 s —
one call's latency each, not serialized). And the engine's own `run_started.pool` for
`baseline-n3-r0` now lists **three devices**, one per host:

```
mac-gabee-...              model=gabee-...      weight=1
local-mihai-...            model=mihai-...      weight=1
worksmacstudio-workhorse-  model=workhorse-...  weight=1
```

The loop now varies node count as its primary dimension (3, 1, 2 on baseline, then the
dispatch-quality arms at 3), and voids any unit whose actual pool differs from the one it asked for.

**One comparability warning:** the three hosts are not identical. `gabee` runs **Q6_K at ctx
193792** while `mihai` and `workhorse` run **Q8_0 at ctx 262144**. So a 3-node run includes a
lower-quant node that a 1-node run does not, and `pick_device` will route to it. Any node-count
delta is a delta of "this fleet", not of "N identical workers" — worth stating before a number
gets read as more general than it is.

### The original finding, kept because it voids the old numbers

Three hosts (Local, WorksMacStudio.lan, Mac.lan) all serve one identifier. Two probes against the
fleet exactly as it is:

- the host-qualified instance name `<deviceId>:<path>` that `lms ps --json` reports as
  `indexedModelIdentifier` is **rejected** by the endpoint: `HTTP 400 Invalid model identifier`
- three concurrent calls on the shared identifier were **all served by one host**; the other two
  never left idle for the duration

`reconcile_pool_with_fleet` (`swarm.rs:2043-2049`) builds one worker per DISTINCT identifier, so it
correctly reports a 1-device pool — the collapse is LM Studio's, not goose's. Every swarm run on
disk confirms it: `run_started.pool` has a single entry and every dispatch went to it, so
`swarm-1node`, `swarm-2node` and `swarm-3node` were three replicates of the same configuration.

**Consequence:** a sweep over `GOOSE_SWARM_MAX_NODES` measures nothing, and the earlier
"more nodes make it worse" table compared a configuration with itself. The loop measures dispatch
quality instead.

**Not yet fixed, and worth fixing:** the engine collapses three resident instances into one device
*silently*. It should say so — two thirds of a fleet going unused is not a detail.

## F3 — Most workers are given another job's rules

From `nodeloop/dispatch_audit.py` over the same three runs:

- **72–80% of dispatches** receive the implementer prompt while not being implementers
  (`kind_prompt` defaults OFF, `swarm.rs:18032`)
- only **20–24%** are actually implementers; **39–47%** own nothing (the `verify::<M>` and
  `verify-e2e::N` fan)
- **3–5 dispatches per run** own a `test_*.py` and are told *"NEVER read the project's TEST files"*
  (`swarm.rs:18100`) — the file they must produce is the file they may not open
- **5 dispatches per run** get `context_slice_len == 0`: no dependency context at all

Earlier work estimated this at 59.9%; on this spec it is higher, because `fan_verify`/`fan_e2e`
generate many owns-nothing tasks.

## F4 — Two grader flaws, caught by controls before anything was believed

`dispatch_audit.py` first docked every owns-nothing verifier for not naming files it is forbidden
to write, then graded verifiers on "names symbols" when what pins a verifier down is the command
it must run. Both were fabricated deductions of exactly the kind this project's standing law
predicts ("a grader's bugs invent defects rather than excuse them"). The self-test now grades per
task kind and asserts both score directions, the vacuous-truth case, and an empty run.

---

## F5 — I almost published "every finding was refuted" off a broken harness

Adversarial round 1 returned `survivors: []` with the note *"every finding was refuted — report
that plainly, do not soften it"*. That was **my bug, not a result.** The workflow's inner
`parallel([...])` was passed promises instead of thunks, so all 34 verification calls failed and
`votes` was empty for every finding — and my survival test was `votes.length > 0 && kills === 0`,
which turns "nothing was checked" into "it did not survive".

Four finder agents had in fact raised **38 findings**, none of which was ever tested. Recovering
them needed a second correction: my journal parser read `label`, but the field is `key`, so the
first recovery attempt also printed zero. Two blind instruments in a row, both reporting a
confident zero.

This is the project's standing law firing twice in five minutes: **a zero is usually a broken
instrument, not an empty world** — and before any zero licenses a conclusion, prove the query can
see the thing at all. The `24 agents completed` count is what refused the first zero, and the raw
journal shape is what refused the second.

Round 1 now dedupes by site before verifying, because three lenses independently raised the 75s
detail budget and three raised the missing event. Independent rediscovery is recorded as
corroboration rather than spent as three separate verifications.

## F6 — Adversarial round 1: 2 of 34 survived, both shipped (commit `1a6849ec2`)

Four independent lenses raised **38 findings**, deduped to 34 sites, and **32 were refuted** by
agents attacking both the defect and its proposed fix. The two that survived:

**The detail fallback fired silently and printed a green check** (`swarm.rs:12410`). The `_ => brief`
arm collapsed timeout / agent error / filler / empty into one untyped fallback, then the same
unconditional green ✓ printed — so a detailer that died was indistinguishable from an architect who
wrote a short line. Both sibling fanouts already report their failures; detail was the only one that
failed invisibly. Now emits `detail_fallback` {task_id, reason, brief_chars, budget_secs} and prints
⚠. The verifier added evidence I did not have: the fallback fired **3 of 8 times** in
`swarm-1node-r0` — `meridian`, `test-api` and `integrate-verify` — the third masked downstream by
the canonical sink override, which is why only two were visible in `plan_loaded`.

**Every read-only verify task was classified as a fix round** (`swarm.rs:18097`). `is_fix_round` was
`owned_files.is_empty() && !all_files.is_empty()`, which is also true of every fanned `verify::<M>`
and `verify-e2e::<i>`. With `read_on_fix` on — and swarm-bench sets it on by default — those
read-only gates were told the read prohibitions were **SUSPENDED**, granted edits across the
manifest, and handed the fabricated premise *"the failure below was already reproduced by running
the app"* when no failure exists. `integrate-verify` is deliberately still included: it owns nothing
too, but it is the run's sole repair point.

Neither is rebuilt into the binary the campaign is running — swapping the engine under live arms
voids comparability. The rebuild waits for a pass boundary and a re-baseline.

## F7 — The fleet's idle time is PLANNING, not scheduling. And it may grow with node count.

`nodeloop/occupancy.py` measures busy node-seconds ÷ (wall × pool). First numbers, and they killed
two of my own hypotheses in a row.

| run | pool | whole-run occupancy | EXECUTE occupancy | before first dispatch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `swarm-1node-r0` | 1 | 0.873 | **1.000** | 964 s |
| `swarm-3node-r0` (archived, 1 device) | 1 | 0.863 | **1.000** | 913 s |
| live `baseline-n3-r0` | 3 | 0.604 | **0.990** | **1,312 s** |

**The scheduler is not the problem.** Across the execute window it owns, it keeps essentially every
node busy essentially all the time — 1.00, 1.00, 0.99.

**Plan width is not the ceiling either.** I claimed it might be, from the whole-run number, and that
was wrong. With measured task durations the live plan's critical path is 1,648 s out of 6,092 s of
total work, so `max_useful_nodes = 3.58` — the plan has enough independent work for more than three
nodes, and a perfect scheduler could reach 1.0 at this pool.

**All of the gap is before the first task is dispatched:** research, scouts, planning drafts,
detailing and contract stubs. 22 minutes on the live run, 39% of its wall so far. Those are real
model calls on real nodes, but none of them emits `task_dispatched`, so the time lands in the
denominator as wall and never in the numerator as busy.

Two consequences:

1. **An instrumentation gap.** The one phase where the fleet's idle time actually lives is the phase
   the instrument cannot see. Occupancy during planning is currently unmeasurable, so "does planning
   use three nodes well" has no answer. Closing that needs planner-side call events (round 1's
   synthesis proposed a `plan_phase` event; it was not among the two findings that survived).
2. **A hypothesis worth testing, not a result.** Pre-execute went 913–964 s at one node to 1,312 s at
   three — 43% longer. `best_of_n` is sized to the fleet (`devices.len().clamp(1,5)`), so three nodes
   means three skeleton drafts where one node means one. If that holds up, adding nodes buys
   parallelism in EXECUTE and pays for it in PLAN. It is n=1 against a 46-point-spread fleet and
   three different plans, so it is a question for the n=1 and n=2 cells, not an answer.

### Instrument bugs found and fixed on the way (three of mine, all caught by data not by my controls)

Occupancy of **1.28 and 1.93 on a one-device pool** — impossible, since a weight-1 device runs one
task at a time. Summing spans double-counted retries and in-flight tasks; a device's busy time is
the **union** of its spans. Same class gave a "biggest task share" of **1.118**, a share above 1.0.
And three *finished* runs were reported as having tasks "in flight" when those tasks had simply
never completed — failures, not work in progress. The self-test now carries the controls that would
have caught all three, plus the invariant that occupancy can never exceed 1.0.

## F8 — Planning fans out correctly across 3 nodes, but the DETAIL failures went UP

The planner-side calls each leave a `.swarm/activity/<kind>-<id>.json` naming the node that ran
them, so the planning phase is measurable today without any engine change.

| run | pool | planner-side calls, by node | plandrafts | detail fallbacks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `swarm-1node-r0` | 1 | 16 all on one node | 1 | 2 |
| `swarm-3node-r0` (archived, 1 device) | 1 | 16 all on one node | 1 | 0 |
| live `baseline-n3-r0` | 3 | **6 / 7 / 6** — gabee / workhorse / mihai | **3** | **4** |

**The fan-out itself is healthy.** 19 planner-side calls spread 6/7/6 across the fleet is near-perfect
balance, and `best_of_n` correctly scaled to three skeleton drafts where a 1-node run gets one.

**But four detail calls fell back to the architect's one-liner**, confirmed by two independent
instruments: `dispatch_audit.py` reading `plan_loaded` descriptions, and the raw description lengths
— `meridian` 116, `store` 124, `test-meridian` 124, `test-api` 146 characters, against a median of
1,055 for the tasks that got a real spec.

`meridian` is the vendor client. It is the module Tier C exists to grade, and it is the *same* module
that got 95 characters in the 44.2% run whose Tier C collapsed to 14.3%.

**The hypothesis this raises is the sharpest node-scaling question yet, and it is NOT yet answered:**
does adding nodes make detail calls *more* likely to fail? Per-node load goes DOWN with three nodes
(6-7 calls each instead of 16), so the naive expectation is fewer timeouts, not more. Candidate
causes worth separating: LM Link adds network latency per call, `gabee` is a lower quant with a
smaller context, and a 3-node fleet makes the architect emit more subtasks (17 vs 14) and therefore
more detail calls under the same fixed 75 s per-call budget.

This is n=1 per node level on a fleet with a measured 46-point spread — exactly what the running
campaign's `fallbacks` column exists to settle, at n≥3 across 3, 1 and 2 nodes. **Nothing here
justifies a fix yet.** Note also that round 1's adversarial pass REFUTED both "raise the 75 s budget"
and "add a retry" on code-reading grounds; if the campaign shows fallbacks rising with node count,
those refutations deserve re-examination against evidence they did not have.

## F9 — My adversarial harness was throwing away two-thirds of its confirmed findings

Round 2 returned **0 survivors of 32** and instructed me to report that plainly. Before believing a
zero I checked the harness: 68 result records = 4 finders + 64 verifiers, no failures, and the
verdict mix was **59 refute-HIGH and 5 confirm-HIGH**. So the verification genuinely ran — but five
HIGH confirmations coexisting with zero survivors is not a coherent verdict, and that is what
exposed the flaw.

**The two verifiers answer different questions.** `votes[0]` asks *is the defect real?*; `votes[1]`
asks *is the proposed fix sound?* They are not redundant voters. My rule killed a finding if
**either** refuted it, which silently conflates "this is not a defect" with "this is a real defect
whose fix is wrong" — and discards the second class entirely.

Replaying round 1 from cache with the corrected rule (0 tokens, 24 ms):

| | old rule | corrected |
|---|---|---|
| survived intact | 2 | **2** |
| real defect, fix refuted | *(discarded)* | **22** |
| genuinely refuted | 32 | **10** |

Twenty-two confirmed defects had been thrown away. The refutations are substantive and several
propose a *better* fix than the finder did — which is exactly the signal the old rule destroyed.

## F10 — The detail budget is pinned at the p100 of the call it bounds

Three independently-raised findings (#1, #5, #16 of the recovered 22) were each refuted with a
variant of *"the defect is real, but a one-constant change is strictly cheaper and strictly better"*.
The measurement in those refutations is the point:

> the SAME `meridian` brief was detailed in **44.5 s** on one run and blew through **75 s** on
> another. The run that lost it shipped a 95-character spec for the module tier C exists to grade —
> 14.3% there, against 85.7% for the run that kept it.

75 s is a bare literal sitting at the *observed maximum* of the call it bounds, so ordinary variance
lands on the far side of it. The sibling CONTRACT fanout — same call shape, same fleet — already
abandoned a small fixed budget for `worker_timeout_secs.max(120)` after a mass stub failure, and its
comment records that reasoning.

**Deliberately not raised.** `detail_budget_secs()` now resolves env > default with the default still
**75**, so baseline stays byte-identical, and the value is echoed in `levers_resolved`. A
`detail_budget` arm (300 s) enters the campaign with a falsifiable prediction written down before the
run: *fallbacks go to ~0 and pre-execute wall grows only slightly, because the budget is a ceiling on
the slow tail, not on the ~50 s mean. If fallbacks do not drop, the ceiling is not the cause and this
whole line of reasoning is wrong.* The constant gets baked when a replicated arm says what it should
be — not because the argument sounds convincing.

## F11 — `scoped_contracts` cannot work under this planner, and I nearly spent three runs proving it

It was queued as a campaign arm on the reasoning that every worker receives the FULL frozen-contract
bundle, so irrelevant interface text grows with the fan. Round 2's adversarial pass confirmed the
defect but refuted the fix, and checking its claim against real plans settled it:

**Zero inter-module dependency edges among code modules, in all three runs measured.** Every code
module is a root. That is by design — the architect prompt says *"Default to a FLAT FAN: make every
module a root with no deps"* (`swarm.rs:11493`), and `relax_contracted_deps` exists to flatten any
chain that survives it.

So a worker's DAG neighbourhood is **itself**. Scoping the bundle to it would delete every sibling
interface and leave only the module's own stub — the one interface it does not need, since it is the
thing writing it. Under a flat fan the full bundle is the *correct* bundle. The lever is inert at
best and destructive at worst, and its precondition is precisely what the planner works to prevent.

Arm removed before it ran; a warning comment now sits on `scoped_contracts_on()`. Measurement time
is the scarce resource here — roughly two hours per unit, three units per arm — and a lever
predicted broken on evidence does not earn three replicates. It becomes meaningful only if plans
ever carry real inter-module edges.

**The three other recovered round-2 defects, triaged and not yet acted on:**
- the dynamic-replan await sits on the dispatch loop and can freeze all placement for up to 25
  minutes (`scheduler.rs:2050`). The refuter's counter-proposal is a resolvable replan budget in
  this repo's established shape (`draft_timeout_secs` / `clarity_probe_secs`), plus making expiry
  distinguishable so a timeout does not consume the replan budget. It also honestly notes the gain
  is small by construction: the gate only fires when two nodes are already idle.
- every parallel fix shard reports the same device id while running on a different host
  (`swarm.rs:21823`) — an observability defect. The refuter's better idea: emit a per-shard event
  carrying {task_id, device, model}, since `device_id` never reaches an event and no fix to a
  console label can be seen fire.

## Open, in flight

- `nodeloop/loop.sh` is running arms `baseline → kind_prompt → scoped_contracts → doc_prefetch`
  at n≥3, raising n rather than stopping when the backlog drains.
- Adversarial round 1 (detail fan-out) is auditing the 75 s cap, the silence, the fallback itself,
  and whether the same shape exists elsewhere (judge-side splits produce a **43-character** task
  statement, `scheduler.rs:57`).

## Standing rules for this loop

- The LM Studio fleet is READ-ONLY. If the engine cannot use what is there, fix the engine.
- Only a deterministic engine event may confer or retract a verdict.
- An arm that moves the build score by less than the replicate spread has said nothing.
- Run the built app before believing any score.
